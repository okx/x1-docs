# Transaction validation
Once the batches have been successfully aggregated on L1, all zkEVM nodes can verify their local L2 state by directly retrieving and validating consolidated roots from the L1 Consensus Contract ([ZkEVM.sol](https://github.com/okx/xlayer-contracts/blob/release/v0.3.0/contracts/v2/consensus/validium/PolygonValidiumEtrog.sol "ZkEVM.sol")). This marks the achievement of a consolidated L2 state.

## Batch rollup verifier
The `rollupVerifier` is an external contract featuring a critical function known as `verifyProof`. This function takes a proof (`proofA`, `proofB`, `proofC`) and an input value called `inputSnark`. It then returns a Boolean value, which is `true` if the proof is valid and false`` if it is not.
Verification of the proof successfully attests to the computation's integrity. However, it does not guarantee the use of correct inputs or the production of accurate output values. To address this, public arguments are employed to openly disclose crucial aspects of computation under scrutiny. This disclosure proves that the computation was executed using the correct inputs and reveals the outputs.
In the process of proof verification, the L1 smart contract configures these public arguments to confirm that the state transition being proven aligns with the execution of batches committed by the trusted sequencer.

## Batch inputSnark
The `inputSnark` serves as a 256-bit unique cryptographic representation of a specific L2 state transition. It is utilized as a public argument. To calculate it, we take the `sha256 modulo % _RFIELD` hash of a byte string referred to as `snarkHashBytes`. The modulo operator is essential due to the mathematical primitives employed in SNARKs.
The `snarkHashBytes` array is computed through a smart contract function known as `getInputSnarkBytes`. It is an ABI-encoded packed string encompassing the following values:

|**Variable name**|**Description**|
|:----|:----|
|msg.sender|The address of the trusted aggregator|
|oldStateRoot|The L2 state root representing the L2 state before the state transition being proven|
|oldAccInputHash|The accumulated hash of the last batch that was aggregated|
|initNumBatch|The index of the last batch that was aggregated|
|chainID|A unique chain identifier|
|newStateRoot|The L2 state root represents the L2 state after the state transition being proven|
|newAccInputHash|The accumulated hash of the last batch in the sequence being aggregated|
|newLocalExitRoot|The root of the bridge's L2 Exit Merkle tree at the conclusion of sequence execution|
|finalNewBatch|The number of the final batch within the execution range|

`inputSnark` encapsulates all the L2 transactions associated with a specific L2 state transition, executed in a specific order, on a specific L2 (`chainID`), and validated by a specific trusted aggregator (`msg.sender`).
The `trustedVerifyBatches` function not only verifies the validity of the zero-knowledge proof but also validates that the value of `inputSnark` corresponds to a pending L2 state transition scheduled for aggregation.
If the internal call to `_verifyAndRewardBatches` returns `true`, it signifies the successful verification of the sequence of batches. Consequently, the `newStateRoot` argument is added to the `batchNumToStateRoot` mapping. The index of the last batch within the sequence is employed as the key for the entry.
Finally, an event named `TrustedVerifyBatches` is emitted:
```solidity
event TrustedVerifyBatches (
  uint64 indexed numBatch,
  bytes32 stateRoot,
  address indexed aggregator
);
```
