# Set up wallets
## What is a wallet?
A crypto wallet serves as a tool for storing, transferring, and engaging with blockchain networks. These wallets come in three primary types: software, hardware, and paper wallets. Depending on their connectivity to the internet, wallets can also be categorized as either "hot" or "cold."

A crypto wallet is composed of pairs of public and private keys. These keys are utilized for signing, sending, receiving transactions, and monitoring asset ownership. The wallet generates a public key from the private key, resulting in a public address represented by alphanumeric characters. This address is used to receive cryptocurrency assets and can be shared with others. However, **the private key must remain confidential** to prevent asset loss.
