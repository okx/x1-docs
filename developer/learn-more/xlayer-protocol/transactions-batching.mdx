# Transaction batching
## Rollup or Validium mode
The trusted sequencer must batch the transactions using the following `BatchData` struct specified in the [ZkEVM.sol](https://github.com/okx/xlayer-contracts/blob/release/v0.3.0/contracts/v2/consensus/validium/PolygonValidiumEtrog.sol "ZkEVM.sol") contract:
```solidity
struct BatchData {
        bytes transactions;
        bytes32 transactionsHash;
        bytes32 globalExitRoot;
        uint64 timestamp;
        uint64 minForcedTimestamp;
}
```
The trusted sequencer can choose [Rollup or Validium](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability/ "Rollup or Validium") mode when invoking the `sequenceBatches` method.
```solidity
function sequenceBatches(
        BatchData[] calldata batches,
        address l2Coinbase,
        bytes calldata signaturesAndAddrs
)
```
- **Rollup**: `BatchData.transactions` data is set using the data from [transactions](#Transactions), while the `signaturesAndAddrs` field is empty.
- **Validium**: The hash calculated based on the [transactions](#Transactions) is set as `BatchData.transactionsHash`. [Transactions](#Transactions) data is signed using the DAC private key from `DataCommittee.sol`, and the resulting signatures are set in the `signaturesAndAddrs` field.

## Batch data parameters
### Transactions
These are byte arrays containing the concatenated batch transactions for rollup mode.
Each transaction is encoded according to the Ethereum pre-EIP-155 or EIP-155 formats using the Recursive-Length Prefix (RLP) standard, but the signature values, `v`,` r`, and `s`, are concatenated as shown below:
1. `EIP-155`:  `rlp(nonce, gasprice, gasLimit, to, value, data, chainid, 0, 0,)`
2. `pre-EIP-155`:  `rlp(nonce,gasprice,gasLimit,to,value,data)`

### GlobalExitRoot
This is the **root of the bridge's Global Exit Merkle Tree**, which will be synchronized in the L2 State at the start of batch execution.
The bridge moves assets back and forth between L1 and L2. To access the assets on the destination network, you need to complete a claiming transaction.

### Timestamp
As Ethereum blocks have timestamps, each batch also has its own timestamp. 
To make sure batches are arranged in chronological order and align with L1 blocks, two conditions must be met:
1. The timestamp of a batch must be equal to or later than the timestamp of the last batch that was sequenced.
2. A trusted sequencer can't assign a batch with a timestamp greater than the timestamp of the L1 block, where the sequencing transaction is processed.

### MinForcedTimestamp
If a batch is a so-called forced batch, this parameter must be greater than zero. Censorship is countered by using forced batches. You can learn more about this in the next section - [Batch Sequencing](/developer/learn-more/xlayer-protocol/batch-sequencing "Batch Sequencing").
